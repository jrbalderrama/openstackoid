"""Keystone middleware decorator for OpenStacko√Ød.

Keystone middleware got a Keystone client in its instance variables, e.g.
`_identity_server`. The Keystone client is instantiated at construction time
using information in service configuration file, e.g. in ``nova.conf``:

.. code-block:: ini

  [keystone_authtoken]
  auth_plugin = password
  auth_url = http://10.0.2.15/identity
  username = nova
  user_domain_id = default
  password = whyarewestillusingpasswords
  project_name = service
  project_domain_id = default

With this configuration, the Keystone client always discuss with the Keystone
of the same Cloud. But when Alice does a:

  openstack image list --os-scope '{"image": "CloudOne", "identity": "CloudTwo"}'

it requires the Keystone middleware of Glance in CloudOne to check the
identity of Alice in CloudTwo. Thus the keystone client has to be modified
to target Keystone of CloudTwo.

One may expect such mechanism to be already catch by HAProxy and the scope and
its true. The request to Keystone CloudOne made by Keystone client will be
catch by HAProxy and forwared to CloudTwo. Unfortunately, the request comes
with a token for the service (the X-Service-Token header) and that one is
scoped to the local Keystone. Hence, we need to build a new client to the good
Keystone in order to craft the good token.

The `target_good_keystone` decorator changes the `_identity_server` in a
BaseAuthProtocol middleware to target the good Keystone based on the scope.

#
#     The `endpoint_data_for` method [1] of keystoneauth1 fetches endpoint data
#     from the service catalog. This method may filter endpoints based on the
#     region name. Thus, when a service such a Nova wanna contact Neutron, it
#     uses that method to look into the catalog and only keep endpoints of
#     Neutron in the same region (see, nova.network.neutronV2.api.get_client
#     [2]).
#
#     However with OpenStacko√Ød, the Identity server of the current composition
#     may be in a different region than Nova. This is the case when Alice start a
#     VM with the following scope:
#
#       openstack server create ... --os-scope '{"identity": "CloudOne", "nova": "CloudTwo"}'
#
#     In this case, Keystone will return a scoped-token with a catalog made of
#     endpoints in CloudOne. Hence, when Nova try to get the list of endpoints of
#     its region, it fails with the error message:
#
#       ['internal', 'public'] endpoint for network service in CloudTwo region not found
#
#     With OpenStacko√Ød, the notion of regions doesn't really make sense since we
#     permit collaboration between multiple regions. This monkey patch removes
#     the region filtering when a service seeks for an endpoint in the service
#     catalog.
